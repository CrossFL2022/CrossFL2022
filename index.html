          Federated Learning - Algorithms, Systems and Co-designs"</strong></p>

      </p>
    

    <hr class="my-4">

<p>Federated Learning (FL) has recently emerged as the de facto
  framework for distributed machine learning (ML) beyond data centers that preserves the privacy
  of data, especially in the proliferation of mobile and edge devices with their increasing capacity
  for sensing, computation and storage. To fully utilize the vast amount of distributed, diverse
  and privately owned data that is stored across these devices, FL provides a platform on which
  local devices can build their own local models whose training processes can be synchronized via
  sharing model updates rather than raw data. Such potential use of FL has since then led to an
  explosive attention from the ML, systems, optimization, signal processing and wireless networking
  communities. During recent years, a growing amount of both theoretical and empirical research
  pushes FL closer to being the new standard of ML as a democratized data analytic service.<p>
<p>FL-related research is evolving at a rapid pace and is
  penetrating into almost every scientific and technologic society. However, as FL comes closer to
  being deployable in real-world scenarios, many open problems in FL today cannot be solved solely
  by researchers in one community. For example, most ML algorithms were originally designed for
  data center environments, but learning in data centers is markedly distinct from learning on devices
  because devices are resource constrained (e.g., bandwidth, memory, and energy), and they can be
  less reliable due to factors such as privacy leakage and malicious attacks. Designing most effcient
  and reliable FL algorithms require leveraging expertises from systems, security, signal processing
  and networking communities. On the other hand, current computing and networking systems are
  designed for content-centric applications using metrics such as latency and throughput, but FL
  traffc is fundamentally different from its traditional counterpart. Specifically, most FL algorithms
  are iterative, but not every iteration of algorithms or every bit of data is equally important. Therefore, designing most effcient and scalable computing and networking systems require leveraging
  collaborative advances from ML, data mining, and optimization communities.<p>
  </p>In light of the differences in education backgrounds, cultures, toolboxes, viewpoints,
  and design principles of different communities, this workshop aims to break community barriers
  and bring researchers from pertinent communities together to address open problems in FL. More
  importantly, this workshop aims to stimulate discussion among experts in different fields (e.g.,
  industry and academia) and identify new problems that remain underexplored from an interdisciplinary perspective. Specifically, the topics of interest include but not limited to: </p>


<ul>
  <li>Adversarial robustness and security in Federated Learning</li>
  <li>Data privacy in Federated Learning</li>
  <li>Mathematical optimization for Federated Learning</li>
  <li>Communication and networking for Federated Learning</li>
  <li>Hardware acceleration for Federated Learning</li>
  <li>Hardware and algorithms co-designs for Federated Learning</li>
  <li>Algorithms and systems co-designs for Federated Learning</li>
</ul>

<p>We hope that this workshop will serve as a forum for researchers across different disciplines to bring forward and discuss challenging topics, share new ideas and exchange experience in the deployment of such systems, both from a theoretical and experimental perspective.</p>

<p>The workshop is co-located with <a href="https://mlsys.org/"><strong>MLSys2022</strong></a> will be <strong>virtually</strong> held in the beautiful city of Santa Clara. All accepted paper will also <strong>be included</strong></p>

<p>The workshop will take place on the <strong>14th of April 2022</strong>.</p>
